# Amazon-Product-Analysis-DSA
Exploring the full Potential of Excel as a tool for Data Analysis with this project on Amazon Product Data. 

# Project Overview
- This project analyzes the Amazon Products at RetailTech Insights to provide business insights through exploratory data analysis and interactive Dashboard. The Project contained 1465 rows and 16 columns. 
- The Project focused on product distributions, customer reviews, and profitability with regards to Sales revenues. 
- Datasets used for the project included records such as;
  - Product details: name, category, price, discount, and ratings
  - Customer engagement: user reviews, titles, and content
  - Each row represents a unique product, with aggregated reviewer data stored as comma-separated values


# Main Highlights Explored
1. Product Profitability: Identifying which Products and Product Category drive the highest sales with consequent increase in demand.
3. Customer Satisfaction: Measuring customers satisfaction with the number of reviews and review counts by Products and Product Category.
4. Reviews and Ratings: Measuring how these indices greatly impacts the sales revenue. A satisfied customer will always advertize a good product or happily increase product sale.

# Tools Used
- Excel: For cleaning Dataset, Annalysis
- Pivot Table: For creating Tables and making Data Charts
- Dashboard: For Visualizing

# Data Processing
# The Workflow included:
  1. Data Importation
  2. Data cleaning and Standardized formatting
    - Duplicates were removed, converted text to column, and missing values handled where applicable. This was done to ensure records contained, maintained data integrity and prevent errors during analysis.
       - TRIM(B2): Product Name Shortening to reduce long product name and product category for cleaner charts
       - =PROPER(C2): Removing extra spaces to achieve clean text fields
       - Delimiter: Using text-to-columns with delimiter such as; "|" , "space", to simplify product Category and Product names.
       - Helper Columns: All calculated columns and cleaning columns used to achieve final analysis, pivot table and dashboard.
